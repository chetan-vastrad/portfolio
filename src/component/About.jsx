              <h2>Who I Am & What Drives Me</h2>
              <h4>A Passion for Continuous Learning</h4>
              <p>
                Iâ€™ve always had a natural curiosity for technology, which led me
                to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My career has been a
                journey of continuous learningâ€”whether itâ€™s mastering new
                frameworks, experimenting with emerging tools, or solving
                complex problems in innovative ways.
              </p>
              <h4>My Approach to Problem-Solving</h4>
              <p>
                I approach every challenge with a growth mindset. I thrive in
                environments that encourage collaboration and creative thinking,
                where I can contribute my technical expertise while learning
                from others.
